# Description

NC News - a social news aggregation, web content rating and discussion website. 
NC News is a single-page application, but because of the using React Router a user will receive all the advantages of routing behavior (i.e. sharing links with friends of a certain article).

#### Navigation

On the top of the app - there is a navigation menu that allows users to
- return to the main page - Home tab; 
- choose and sort all articles by topic - Topics tab - all available topics are fetched from the database;
- write and post a new article - Add New Article tab - will redirect you to the form to be completed if you would like to post an article.
On the top right of the app - there is a username who has logged in.
For a demonstration purpose, the active user was hardcoded - grumpy19. The main aim is to show that only registered users are allowed to write and post a new article, leave comments and delete your own comments as well. 

#### Home page 

renders articles of all topics sorted by the date of publication: new comes first.
There is also an additional navigation bar allowing the user 
- to choose how to display articles: 
old first
new first
- to sort articles by: 
Votes from High to Low (an article that has the most number of likes comes first), 
Votes from Low to High - just reverse display;
Comment count from High to Low (article that has more comments on it comes first),
Comment count from Low to High - just reverse display.

Each article card on the Home page also includes some navigation:
- title of the article - click on it and you will be redirected to the page of this article;
- Created by: author - click on author to see all articles of this author;
- on the bottom left of the card there is a Topic name, which also is clickable and allows you to sort all articles by the Topic name.

#### Single Article

displays an article,
allows users to "like"/"dislike" articles,
add a new comment,
delete your own comment,
"like"/"dislike" comments

#### Add New Article

page with a form of adding a new article.
Title, topic and article body - are required fields and the form would not allow you to submit (send) it until you fill them in.
Img URL - is optional.

#### Errors

Bad route errors result in the Error page with a relevant  400/404 message.
If errors occur while voting or posting/deleting comments - a user will receive a message.
